        <h2>Gear</h2>
        <p>Running shoes: Good running shoes are crucial to prevent injury and improve performance. Look for shoes that fit well, provide good support, and are appropriate for your foot type and the type of terrain you'll be running on. Comfortable clothing: Choose lightweight, breathable clothing that allows for a full range of motion. Look for moisture-wicking fabrics that will keep you dry and comfortable during your run. Socks: Invest in good quality running socks that are comfortable and prevent blisters. Watch or fitness tracker: A watch or fitness tracker can help you keep track of your progress, monitor your heart rate, and set goals. Water bottle or hydration pack: Staying hydrated is important during runs, especially in hot weather. Consider carrying a water bottle or hydration pack to ensure you have enough water on hand. Reflective gear: If you'll be running in low-light conditions, be sure to wear reflective gear to improve your visibility and stay safe. Accessories: Other accessories that may be useful include a hat or visor to protect your face from the sun, sunglasses, and a running belt or armband to hold your phone, keys, and other small items.
