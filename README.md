The name of our project, Cursus, originates from Latin, which can mean running, course, or a journey. Cursus is designed to accomplish 2 main goals. One is to help more people start and enjoy running, and help them stay motivated. The second goal is to make running more convenient for both new and experienced runners in Philadelphia. Cursus includes trails in Philadelphia for runners that are looking for a good spot to run. Cursus also have different running groups for runners to join and run with, and a list of races that takes place annually in Philadelphia.
